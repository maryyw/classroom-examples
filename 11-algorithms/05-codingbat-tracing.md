# Codingbat Solution Tracing - Recursion-1
This is a collection of [Codingbat](http://codingbat.com) solutions that may or may not work. 
The idea is to trace the code to discover the errors or to determine if the solution is infact correct.

## Adding a post
Simply edit this document and add your code as shown below with the following rules:
1. Ensure your code is within triple backticks like below. 
2. Add [type annotations](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) for the function header so we know what type of data the function recieves and returns.
3. Ensure that the name of the function is under an appropriate `###` header.
4. Ensure that the problem's explanation text is above all the "solutions". 
5. Keep the problems in alpha order.

## Example:
### double
Create a function that will double the given integer.
```
double(5) -> 10
double(3) -> 6
double(0) -> 0
```
Solutions:

```python
def double(n: int) -> int:
    return n * 2
```

```python
def double(n: int) -> int:
    return n * 1
```

## array11
Given an array of ints, compute recursively the number of times that the value 11 appears in the array. We'll use the convention of considering only the part of the array that begins at the given index. In this way, a recursive call can pass index+1 to move down the array. The initial call will pass in index as 0.
```
array220([1, 2, 20], 0) → true
array220([3, 30], 0) → true
array220([3], 0) → false
```
Solutions:

```python
from typing import List

def array11(numbers: List[int], i: int) -> int:
    if i >= len(numbers):
        return 0

    if numbers[i] == 11:
        return 1 + array11(numbers, i + 1)
    return 0 + array11(numbers, i + 1)
```
